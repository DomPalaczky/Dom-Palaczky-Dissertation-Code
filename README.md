## Jupyter Notebook Examples:

Aggregate Visuals - Distrubution based visuals post clustering

Kmeans Implementation - How Kmeans has been implemented in this script

SOM implementation - How SOM has been implemented in this script

Script - An example of the script running

Time Visuals - Short time series analysis of clusters

Validation - Examlples of how the process has been validated
